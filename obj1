1. Backend (Node.js + Express + WebSocket): --- done
* Set up an Express server.
* Integrate a database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL) to store user data, stock data, and transaction history.
* Implement RESTful API endpoints:
    * POST /api/register - Register a new user.

* Implement real-time notifications for stock price changes and user transactions.


1. Setup Express Server:
    * Initialize a Node.js project with Express.
    * Install necessary dependencies: express, mongoose or pg, socket.io, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, cors.
2. Database Integration:
    * Set up MongoDB or PostgreSQL and define schemas for users, stocks, and transactions.
    * Create models for storing user data, stock data, and transaction history.
3. API Endpoints:
    * Implement user authentication endpoints (register, login).
    * Implement stock trading endpoints (stocks, buy, sell).
    * Implement transaction history endpoint (transactions).
4. WebSocket Integration:
    * Set up Socket.io on the server to handle real-time connections.
    * Handle events for real-time stock price updates and notifications.
5. Stock Price Data:
    * Integrate a third-party API to fetch real-time stock prices (e.g., Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud).
    * Implement a service to fetch and broadcast stock prices periodically.
