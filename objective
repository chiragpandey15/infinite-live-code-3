Task: Build a Real-Time Stock Trading Platform
Requirements:
1. Backend (Node.js + Express + WebSocket):
* Set up an Express server.
* Integrate a database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL) to store user data, stock data, and transaction history.
* Implement RESTful API endpoints:
    * POST /api/register - Register a new user.
    * POST /api/login - User login.
    * GET /api/stocks - Retrieve current stock data.
    * POST /api/stocks/buy - Buy a stock.
    * POST /api/stocks/sell - Sell a stock.
    * GET /api/transactions - Retrieve user's transaction history.
* Set up WebSocket (using Socket.io) for real-time stock price updates.
* Implement real-time notifications for stock price changes and user transactions.
2. Frontend (React):
* Create a React application using create-react-app.
* Set up React Router for navigating between pages (e.g., Login, Dashboard, Stock Details).
* Create components for user registration, login, dashboard, stock list, stock details, and transaction history.
* Use Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend API.
* Implement WebSocket client (using Socket.io-client) to handle real-time stock price updates.
* Implement real-time notifications for price changes and transactions.
* Implement user authentication and authorization using JWT.
Detailed Steps:
Backend:
1. Setup Express Server:
    * Initialize a Node.js project with Express.
    * Install necessary dependencies: express, mongoose or pg, socket.io, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, cors.
2. Database Integration:
    * Set up MongoDB or PostgreSQL and define schemas for users, stocks, and transactions.
    * Create models for storing user data, stock data, and transaction history.
3. API Endpoints:
    * Implement user authentication endpoints (register, login).
    * Implement stock trading endpoints (stocks, buy, sell).
    * Implement transaction history endpoint (transactions).
4. WebSocket Integration:
    * Set up Socket.io on the server to handle real-time connections.
    * Handle events for real-time stock price updates and notifications.
5. Stock Price Data:
    * Integrate a third-party API to fetch real-time stock prices (e.g., Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud).
    * Implement a service to fetch and broadcast stock prices periodically.
Frontend:
1. Setup React Application:
    * Initialize a React project using create-react-app.
    * Install necessary dependencies: axios, react-router-dom, socket.io-client.
2. Routing:
    * Set up routes for Login, Dashboard, Stock Details, and Transaction History pages using React Router.
3. Components:
    * Login Component:
        * Implement user login functionality.
    * Register Component:
        * Implement user registration functionality.
    * Dashboard Component:
        * Display a list of available stocks and their current prices.
        * Allow users to buy or sell stocks.
    * Stock Details Component:
        * Display detailed information about a specific stock.
        * Show real-time price updates and trading options.
    * Transaction History Component:
        * Display the user's transaction history.
4. State Management:
    * Manage application state using Context API or Redux.
    * Handle user authentication state, stock data, and transaction history.
5. Real-Time Features:
    * Ensure real-time stock price updates using WebSocket.
    * Implement real-time notifications for stock price changes and user transactions.
